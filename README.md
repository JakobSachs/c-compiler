# C Compiler

A simple C compiler written in Rust using LALRPOP for parsing.

The compiler currently handles basic C syntax and expressions, with plans to expand functionality in future stages.

## Features
- Lexical analysis and parsing using LALRPOP
- AST generation and semantic analysis
- Code generation (planned)
- Support for basic C constructs (variables, expressions, control flow)

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for the compiler
- `tests/`: Test cases organized by implementation stage
